Solar type 1 2 3
Wind tupe A B C 

& (WindData['type'] == 'A')

 & (SolarData['type'] == 1)

Best wind turbine is type C
Best solar panel is type 2


What to do, calculate the mean energy generated in a year by type C and type 2 of a single unit. Than extrapolate that to the ones we will invest in.
